# Conclusion
Sales of medicines increase at the beginning of the year, especially in January. This is because that month is the peak of the rainy season which causes many diseases.
# Suggestion
Needs important attention, especially from March to June so that sales can increase, because that month enters the vacation time of school children. the thing to do is to open up opportunities for companies to hold promotions for every purchase of children's products and discounts for purchases of a certain nominal value, even if the company can participate with tourist attractions to hold promotional activities on the spot.
